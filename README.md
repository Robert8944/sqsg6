# CS499

Code is written in SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, with some loaded libraries in JavaScript. 
Code must be run on an Apache webserver with PHP installed and configured, and MySQL (or an equivalent for your distrobution such as MariaDB) running with a 'cs499' table.
To run the website, the 'sqsg6' directory (obtainable by cloning this Git Repository) simply needs to be placed wherever your webserver serves code to apache, usually /var/www/html/ (on Ubuntu distributions) or /srv/httpd/ (on Archlinux/Slackware distributions). Without a MySQL service running with the apropriate tables and databse the website main page (index.php) will still display, although you will not be able to sign in or register users.

All SQL tables have corresponding 'table name'.sql files that will create the apropriate DDL in MySQL. 

All code is generated by PHP code in a filename that corresponds to the page displayed ('index.php' will load when accessing the website root, 'Training-Site/', 'groups.php' will load the 'groups/' page)
